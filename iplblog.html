        <p>Mumbai Indians (MI): For readers who have been following our IPL 2020 Teams’ Analysis and Predictions, they
          would
          know that we feel Mumbai Indians are among the top 2 strongest teams of IPL. And that is for the obvious
          reason
          that they have an equally great combination of Indian and overseas players. This combination opens the
          opportunity
          to replace or rest players at will as this is a long tournament with 15 to 17 matches. The other teams seem to
          depend more on the overseas players (the irony being – only 4 are to be taken in the team).

        <h2> DREAM11 IPL 2020 Team analysis: Chennai Super Kings (CSK): Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats,
          Prediction</h2>
        <h5>Title description, Sep 2, 2017</h5>

        <p> team which has won 3 championships and narrowly missed the fourth – Chennai Super Kings. A team that has
          reached
          the playoffs every single season of IPL. Sailing through pressure with poise, CSK is a winner in itself.
          Filled
          with experience, talent, and power, they refuse to be derailed no matter what hits them.

        <h2> KXIP vs RCB DREAM11 Team Prediction: Sept 23rd, 2020</h2>
        <h5>Title description, Sep 2, 2017</h5>


        <p> KXIP has been unable to register a win over RCB for quite a while. Their last dismissal of RCB was on 5 May
          in the 2017 IPL where KXIP made 138/7 after losing the toss and going in to bat first. RCB was all out for 119
          in 19 overs. RCB have dominated the Kings in the last few matches. Will they be able to do it again? They have
          to consider the returning talent on board the Punjab team – Glenn Maxwell. Back fresh from their recent
          victory over SRH where Saini and Chahal did a good job for RCB in yesterday’s match – Will they repeat it?
